fruit-ninja-menu
================

Scroll over menu for Softgames' Fruit Ninja.

There is a new button on the top left side of the screen; everytime the users clicks it, a slide over menu appears, giving the posibility of rating the game with 5 stars, sharing in facebook or twitter and a link to see more games.

The callbacks for the click action was made with some alert messages, although the links open in a new tab/window.

For the star rating the jQuery plugin [RateIt](http://rateit.codeplex.com/) was used.

##Added files

Three folders were added to the project: <b>custom-css</b>, <b>custom-img</b> and <b>custom-js</b>. These folders contain the custom files necessary to achieve the menu and the RateIt jQuery plugin files.
